# Angular frontend

This directory is reserved for the Angular SPA that will power the upload/sync UI.

Suggested next steps:
- Scaffold the app here (e.g., `npx @angular/cli new sync-ui --directory .` or within a `sync-ui/` subfolder).
- Build a form for multi-file upload, per-video offsets, audio selection, and progress polling against the FastAPI backend.
