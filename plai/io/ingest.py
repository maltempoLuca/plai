"""Video ingest and metadata helpers (placeholder).

Planned responsibilities (Phase 0):
- ffprobe wrappers to extract duration, fps, resolution, rotation metadata.
- Timestamped frame iterator contract (using cv2/ffmpeg decode) with awareness of rotation.
- Utilities to compute analysis rate and map frame indices <-> timestamps.

Implementation will land in upcoming Phase 0 steps.
